# Fetch-Metadata-Team-88

### This team is building a web app that extracts metadata of files

---

In this project we used Django to build a web based metadata extraction web app, for any kind of a file. You upload a file, and the web app extracts the metadata, saves it as a json file, and you can download, and share the metadata and file.
